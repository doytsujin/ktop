A `top`-like tool for your Kubernetes cluster.

Following the tradition of Unix/Linux `top` tools, `ktop` is a tool that displays useful metrics information about nodes, pods, and other workload resources running in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Features

* Insightful summary of cluster resource metrics
* Ability to work with or without a metrics-server deployed
* Displays nodes and pods usage metrics when a Metrics Server is found
* Uses your existing cluster configuration to connect to a cluster's API server

## Installing ktop

### kubectl `ktop` plugin

Project `ktop` is distributed as a kubectl plugin.  To use ktop as a plugin do the followings:

* [Install](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/) `krew` plugin manager (if not present)
* Ensure ktop is available to be installed: `kubectl krew search ktop`
* Next, install the plugin: `kubectl krew install ktop`

Once installed, start the ktop plugin with

```
kubectl ktop
```

### Download binary

Another easy way to get started with ktop is to download the pre-built binary (for your system):

> https://github.com/vladimirvivien/ktop/releases/latest

Then, extract the ktop binary and copy it to your system's execution path.

### Using `go install`

If you have a recent version of Go installed (1.14 or later) you can build and install ktop as follows:

```
go install github.com/vladimirvivien/ktop@latest
```

This should place the ktop binary in your configured `$GOBIN` path or place it in its default location, `$HOME/go/bin`.

### Build from source

Download or clone the source (from GitHub). From the project's root directory, do the following:

```
go build .
```

The project also comes with a Go program that you can use for cross-platform builds.
```
go run ./ci/build.go
```

## Running ktop

With a locally accessible kubeconfig file on your machine, ktop can be executed simply:

```
ktop
```

The previous command will use either environment variable `$KUBECONFIG` or the default path for the kubeconfig file. The program currently accepts the following arguments:

```
Usage:
  ktop [flags]

Flags:
  -A, --all-namespaces                 If true, display metrics for all accessible namespaces
      --as string                      Username to impersonate for the operation. User could be a regular user or a service account in a namespace.
      --as-group stringArray           Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
      --as-uid string                  UID to impersonate for the operation.
      --cache-dir string               Default cache directory (default "${HOME}/.kube/cache")
      --certificate-authority string   Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
      --client-certificate string      Path to a client certificate file for TLS
      --client-key string              Path to a client key file for TLS
      --cluster string                 The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
      --context string                 The name of the kubeconfig context to use
  -h, --help                           help for ktop
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify       If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
      --kubeconfig string              Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
  -n, --namespace string               If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
      --request-timeout string         The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests. (default "0")
  -s, --server string                  The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
      --tls-server-name string         Server name to use for server certificate validation. If it is not provided, the hostname used to contact the server is used
      --token string                   Bearer token for authentication to the API server
      --user string                    The name of the kubeconfig user to use```
```

For instance, the following will show cluster information for workload resources associated with namespace `my-app` in context `web-cluster` using the default kubconfig file path:

```
ktop --namespace my-app --context web-cluster
```

## ktop metrics

The ktop UI provides several metrics including a high-level summary of workload components installed on your cluster:

### Usage metrics from `metrics-server`

ktop can display metrics with or without Metrics Server present.  When a cluster has an instance of a [kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) installed (and properly configured), ktop will automatically discover the server as shown:

<h1 align="center">
    <img src="./docs/ktop-metrics-connected.png" alt="ktop">
</h1>

With the metrics server installed, ktop will display resource utilization metrics as reported by the Metrics Server.

### Request/limit metrics

When there is no Metrics Server present in the cluster, ktop will still work:

    <img src="./docs/ktop-metrics-not-connected.png" alt="ktop">
</h1>

Instead of resource utilization, ktop will display resource requests and limits for nodes and pods.

## Roadmap

* A multi-page UI to display metrics for additional components
* Display OOM processes
* Additional installation methods (Homebrew, linux packages, etc)
* Etc
